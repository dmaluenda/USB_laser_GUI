# USB laser GUI

This software provides a GUI to manage the Monocrom C4050USB-SMF USBlaser (Diode Laser Pigtailed at 405nm -BLUE-) via the USB PIC CTL 7V driver.


       --- RUN THE .m SCRIPT instead of opening the .fig ---

 USB PIC CTL 7V driver is employed as a SERIAL PORT, thus before running
 this script, the name of the SERIAL PORT must be known.
 A pop up menu shows all available ports then, choose the correct one.

 This program is made and tested in a MATLAB r2015b in a MacOS platform.
 Whitout installing any previous driver (just PlugAndPlay), the laser is
 connected to the port named '/dev/tty.usbmodemXXXXX'.
